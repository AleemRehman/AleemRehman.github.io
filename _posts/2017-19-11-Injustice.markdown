On the 14th of June Grenfell tower in North Kensington went up in flames. This fire was preventable. The events before this would define the state of the establishment running the country, later going on to define their blatant disregard for middle class lives.

The rapid growth of the fire in the building has been attributed to the cladding that was put on the outside of the building, this cladding was added in an effort to beautify the outside of the building for the surrounding residents. In this effort of beautification, lives have been lost and many scarred. 

Ask yourself, why was the beautification required?
Why is the amount of residents who lost their lives being under-exaggerated?
